Given different features of tests conducted, need to classify type of Cancer
Number of Instances: 339
Number of Attributes: 18 including the class attribute

Feature Analysis and Selection:
Chi-Square (all independent variables are categorical, so needed to check relationship with the categorical target)
Random-Forest classification's feature importance/selection technique

Model development:
Decision Trees, 
Random Forest,
K-Nearest-Neighbours
Gaussian Naive-Bayes
Support-Vector-Classifier
DNN using Keras

Have compared the accuracy metrics like accuracy-scores between all the above applied models over the dataset.
